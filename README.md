# Python-Script-for-Triangle-Properties-Calculation
This Python script defines two classes, Shape and Triangle, to represent shapes and calculate properties of triangles, respectively. The Shape class holds information about the color and filled status of a shape, while the Triangle class, a subclass of Shape, computes the area and perimeter of a triangle.
